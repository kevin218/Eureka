# Plotting parameters
y_params        'rprs'  # The parameter name as entered in your EPF file in Stage 5. rp^2, 1/r1, and 1/r4 are also permitted.
y_labels        None  # The formatted string you want on the y-label. Set to None to use the default formatting.
y_label_units   None  # The formatted string for the units you want on the y-label - e.g., (ppm), (seconds), '(days$^{-1})$', etc.. Set to None to automatically add any implied units from y_scalars (e.g. ppm), or set to '' to force no units.
y_scalars       1     # Can be used to convert to percent (100), ppm (1e6), etc.
x_unit          um    # Options include any measurement of light included in astropy.units.spectral (e.g. um, nm, Hz, etc.)

# Tabulating parameters
ncol            4  # The number of columns you want in your LaTeX formatted tables

# This section is relevant if isplots_S6>=3
# Scale height parameters (if you want a second copy of the plot with a second y-axis with units of scale height)
star_Rad		0.6506 # The radius of the star in units of solar radii
planet_Teq		1400 # The equilibrium temperature of the planet in units of Kelvin
planet_Mass		2 # The planet's mass in units of Jupiter radii (used to calculate surface gravity)
planet_Rad		None # The planet's radius in units of Jupiter radii (used to calculate surface gravity); Set to None to use the average fitted radius
planet_mu		2.3 # The mean molecular mass of the atmosphere (in atomic mass units)
planet_R0		None # The reference radius (in Jupiter radii) for the scale height measurement; Set to None to use the mean fitted radius

model_y_unit	Rp/Rs # Options include Rp/Rs, (Rp/Rs)^2, Fp/Fs
model_y_scalar	1 # Indicate whether model y-values have already been scaled (e.g. write 1e6 if model_spectrum is in ppm)
model_zorder    1 # The zorder of the model on the plot (0 for beneath the data, 1 for above the data)
