run_myfuncs     [fleck_tr,batman_ecl,sinusoid_pc,expramp,polynomial,xpos,ypos] #options are: batman_tr, batman_ecl, sinusoid_pc, expramp, polynomial, step, and GP (can list multiple types separated by commas)

# Manual clipping in time
manual_clip     None  # A list of lists specifying the start and end integration numbers for manual removal.

# Limb darkening controls
# IMPORTANT: limb-darkening coefficients are not automatically fixed then, change to 'fixed' in .epf file whether they should be fixed or fitted!
use_generate_ld  None  # use the generated limb-darkening coefficients from Stage 4? Options: exotic-ld, None. For exotic-ld, the limb-darkening laws available are linear, quadratic, 3-parameter and 4-parameter non-linear.

ld_file_white    None  # Fully qualified path to the location of a limb darkening file that you want to use for the white-light light curve (required if ld_file is not None and any EPF parameters are set to white_free or white_fixed).
