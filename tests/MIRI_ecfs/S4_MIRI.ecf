# Number of spectroscopic channels spread evenly over given wavelength range
nspecchan   	1		# Number of spectroscopic channels spread evenly over given wavelength range. Set to None to leave the spectrum unbinned.
compute_white   True    # Also compute the white-light lightcurve
wave_min    	None	# Minimum wavelength

allapers		True	# Run S4 on all of the apertures considered in S3? Otherwise will use newest output in the inputdir

# Parameters for drift correction of 1D spectra
recordDrift     False   # Set True to record drift/jitter in 1D spectra (always recorded if correctDrift is True)
correctDrift    False   # Set True to correct drift/jitter in 1D spectra (not recommended for simulated data)
drift_preclip   0       # Ignore first drift_preclip points of spectrum
drift_postclip  100     # Ignore last drift_postclip points of spectrum, None = no clipping
drift_range     11      # Trim spectra by +/-X pixels to compute valid region of cross correlation
drift_hw        5       # Half-width in pixels used when fitting Gaussian, must be smaller than drift_range
drift_iref      -1      # Index of reference spectrum used for cross correlation, -1 = last spectrum
sub_mean        True    # Set True to subtract spectrum mean during cross correlation
sub_continuum	True	# Set True to subtract the continuum from the spectra using a highpass filter
highpassWidth	10		# The integer width of the highpass filter when subtracting the continuum

# Parameters for sigma clipping
clip_unbinned   False   # Whether or not sigma clipping should be performed on the unbinned 1D time series
clip_binned     True    # Whether or not sigma clipping should be performed on the binned 1D time series
sigma			5		# The number of sigmas a point must be from the rolling median to be considered an outlier
box_width		5		# The width of the box-car filter (used to calculated the rolling median) in units of number of data points
maxiters		5		# The number of iterations of sigma clipping that should be performed.
boundary        'fill'  # Use 'fill' to extend the boundary values by the median of all data points (recommended), 'wrap' to use a periodic boundary, or 'extend' to use the first/last data points
fill_value		mask	# Either the string 'mask' to mask the outlier values (recommended), 'boxcar' to replace data with the mean from the box-car filter, or a constant float-type fill value.
