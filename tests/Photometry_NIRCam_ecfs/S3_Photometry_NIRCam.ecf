ncpu            1           # Number of CPUs
nfiles          1           # The number of data files to analyze simultaneously
max_memory      0.5         # The maximum fraction of memory you want utilized by read-in frames (this will reduce nfiles if need be)
suffix          calints     # Data file suffix
photometry      True        # Set to True if the user wants to analyze a photometric dataset

convert_to_e    True        # Whether or not a conversion to electrons should be performed (can set to False to compute flux-calibrated spectra/photometry)

# Subarray region of interest
ywindow         [4, 256]     # Vertical axis as seen in DS9
xwindow         [512, 1536]  # Horizontal axis as seen in DS9
dqmask          True         # Mask pixels with an odd entry in the DQ array

# Background parameters
flag_bg         False        # Do outlier rejection along time axis for each individual pixel?
bg_thresh       [5,5]        # Double-iteration X-sigma threshold for outlier rejection along time axis

# Photometric extraction parameters
interp_method    linear      # Interpolate bad pixels. Options: None (if no interpolation should be performed), linear, nearest, cubic
centroid_method  mgmc        # Method used for centroiding. Options: mgmc, fgc
ctr_cutout_size  7           # Cutoff size all around the centroid after the coarse centroid calculation
oneoverf_corr    median      # Options: None, meanerr, median
oneoverf_dist    300         # How many pixels away from the centroid should be considered as background? (used for 1/f correction)
skip_apphot_bg   True        # Skips the background subtraction during the aperture photometry step
photap           60          # Size of photometry aperture in pixels
skyin            70          # Inner sky annulus edge, in pixels
skywidth         20          # Width of the sky annulus, in pixels
centroid_tech    com         # (mgmc method param) Technique used for centroiding. Options: com, 1dg, 2dg
gauss_frame      100         # (mgmc method param) Half-width away from second centroid guess to include in centroiding map for gaussian widths. Options: his should be set to something larger than your expected PSF size; ~100 for defocused NIRCam photometry, or ~15 for MIRI photometry.

# Diagnostics

nplots          5           # How many of each type of figure do you want to make per file?
testing_S3      False       # Boolean, set True to only use last file and generate select figures
hide_plots      True        # If True, plots will automatically be closed rather than popping up
save_output     True        # Save outputs for use in S4
verbose         False       # If True, more details will be printed about steps
