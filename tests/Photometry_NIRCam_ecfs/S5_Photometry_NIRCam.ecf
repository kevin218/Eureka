allapers        True # Run S5 on all of the apertures considered in S4? Otherwise will use newest output in the inputdir

verbose         False # If True, more details will be printed about steps
fit_method      [lsq] #options are: lsq, emcee, dynesty (can list multiple types separated by commas)
run_myfuncs     [batman_tr, polynomial, xpos, ypos] #options are: batman_tr, batman_ecl, sinusoid_pc, expramp, polynomial, step, and GP (can list multiple types separated by commas)

# Manual clipping in time
manual_clip     None   # A list of lists specifying the start and end integration numbers for manual removal.

# Limb darkening controls
# IMPORTANT: limb-darkening coefficients are not automatically fixed then, change to 'fixed' in .epf file whether they should be fixed or fitted!
use_generate_ld  None  # use the generated limb-darkening coefficients from Stage 4? Options: exotic-ld, None. For exotic-ld, the limb-darkening laws available are linear, quadratic, 3-parameter and 4-parameter non-linear.
ld_file          None  # Fully qualified path to the location of a limb darkening file that you want to use
ld_file_white    None  # Fully qualified path to the location of a limb darkening file that you want to use for the white-light light curve (required if ld_file is not None and any EPF parameters are set to white_free or white_fixed).

lsq_method      Powell # The scipy.optimize.minimize optimization method to use
lsq_tol         1e-6 # The tolerance for the scipy.optimize.minimize optimization method

# Plotting controls
interp          False # Should astrophysical model be interpolated (useful for uneven sampling like that from HST)

# Diagnostics

testing_S5      False # Boolean, set True to only use the first spectral channel
testing_model   False # Boolean, set True to only inject a model source of systematics
