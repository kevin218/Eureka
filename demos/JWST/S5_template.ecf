rescale_err     False                   # Rescale uncertainties to have reduced chi-squared of unity
fit_par         ./S5_fit_par_template.epf   # What fitting epf do you want to use?
verbose         True                    # If True, more details will be printed about steps
fit_method      [dynesty]               #options are: lsq, emcee, dynesty (can list multiple types separated by commas)
run_myfuncs     [batman_tr,polynomial]  # options are: batman_tr, batman_ecl, sinusoid_pc, expramp, polynomial, step, xpos, ypos, xwidth, ywidth, and GP (can list multiple types separated by commas)

# Manual clipping in time
manual_clip     None    # A list of lists specifying the start and end integration numbers for manual removal.

# Limb darkening controls
# IMPORTANT: limb-darkening coefficients are not automatically fixed then, change to 'fixed' in .epf file whether they should be fixed or fitted!
use_generate_ld  None  # use the generated limb-darkening coefficients from Stage 4? Options: exotic-ld, None. For exotic-ld, the limb-darkening laws available are linear, quadratic, 3-parameter and 4-parameter non-linear.
ld_file          None  # Fully qualified path to the location of a limb darkening file that you want to use
ld_file_white    None  # Fully qualified path to the location of a limb darkening file that you want to use for the white-light light curve (required if ld_file is not None and any EPF parameters are set to white_free or white_fixed).

# General fitter
old_fitparams   None # filename relative to topdir that points to a fitparams csv to resume where you left off (set to None to start from scratch)

#lsq
lsq_method      'Powell' # The scipy.optimize.minimize optimization method to use
lsq_tol         1e-6    # The tolerance for the scipy.optimize.minimize optimization method
lsq_maxiter     None    # Maximum number of iterations to perform. Depending on the method each iteration may use several function evaluations. Set to None to use the default value

#mcmc
old_chain       None    # Output folder relative to topdir that contains an old emcee chain to resume where you left off (set to None to start from scratch)
lsq_first       True    # Initialize with an initial lsq call (can help shorten burn-in, but turn off if lsq fails). Only used if old_chain is None
run_nsteps      1000
run_nwalkers    200
run_nburn       500     # How many of run_nsteps should be discarded as burn-in steps

#GP inputs
kernel_inputs   ['time'] #options: time
kernel_class    ['Matern32'] #options: ExpSquared, Matern32, Exp, RationalQuadratic for george, Matern32 for celerite (sums of kernels possible for george separated by commas)
GP_package      'celerite' #options: george, celerite

# Plotting controls
interp          False   # Should astrophysical model be interpolated (useful for uneven sampling like that from HST)

# Diagnostics
isplots_S5      5       # Generate few (1), some (3), or many (5) figures (Options: 1 - 5)
nbin_plot       100     # The number of bins that should be used for figures 5104 and 5304. Defaults to 100.
testing_S5      False   # Boolean, set True to only use the first spectral channel
testing_model   False   # Boolean, set True to only inject a model source of systematics
hide_plots      False   # If True, plots will automatically be closed rather than popping up

# Project directory
topdir          /home/User/Data/JWST-Sim/NIRSpec/

# Directories relative to topdir
inputdir        Stage4   # The folder containing the outputs from Eureka!'s S4 pipeline (will be overwritten if calling S4 and S5 sequentially)
