# Stage 3 Documentation: https://eurekadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ecf.html#stage-3

ncpu            4           # Number of CPUs
nfiles          1           # The number of data files to analyze simultaneously
max_memory      0.5         # The maximum fraction of memory you want utilized by read-in frames (this will reduce nfiles if need be)
indep_batches   False       # Independently treat each batch of files? Strongly recommended to leave this as False unless you have a clear reason to set it to True.
suffix          calints     # Data file suffix
photometry      True        # Set to True if the user wants to analyse a photometric dataset

calibrated_spectra  False   # Set True to generate flux-calibrated spectra/photometry in mJy
                            # Set False to convert to electrons

# Subarray region of interest
ywindow         [400, 650]  # Vertical axis as seen in DS9
xwindow         [550, 800]  # Horizontal axis as seen in DS9
dqmask          True        # Mask pixels with an odd entry in the DQ array

# Background parameters
flag_bg         True        # Do outlier rejection along time axis for each individual pixel?
bg_thresh       [5,5]       # Double-iteration X-sigma threshold for outlier rejection along time axis

# Photometric extraction parameters
interp_method   linear      # Interpolate bad pixels. Options: None (if no interpolation should be performed), linear, nearest, cubic
ctr_guess       [698, 516]  # Initial guess of centroid position. If None, will first perform centroiding on whole frame (can sometimes fail)
ctr_cutout_size 10          # Cutoff size all around the centroid after the coarse centroid calculation or first centroid guess when using the mgmc method.
centroid_method mgmc        # Method used for centroiding. Options: mgmc, fgc
skip_apphot_bg  False       # Skips the background subtraction during the aperture photometry step
photap          5           # Size of photometry aperture in pixels
skyin           12          # Inner sky annulus edge, in pixels
skywidth        18          # Width of the sky annulus, in pixels
centroid_tech   com         # (mgmc method param) Technique used for centroiding. Options: com, 1dg, 2dg
gauss_frame     15          # (mgmc method param) Half-width away from second centroid guess to include in centroiding map for gaussian widths. Recommend ~15 for MIRI photometry.

# Diagnostics
isplots_S3      3           # Generate few (1), some (3), or many (5) figures (Options: 1 - 5)
nplots          5           # How many of each type of figure do you want to make per file?
testing_S3      False       # Boolean, set True to only use last file and generate select figures
hide_plots      True        # If True, plots will automatically be closed rather than popping up
save_output     True        # Save outputs for use in S4
save_fluxdata   False       # Save the much larger FluxData.h5 outputs which can be useful for debugging or comparisons between different pipelines
verbose         True        # If True, more details will be printed about steps
