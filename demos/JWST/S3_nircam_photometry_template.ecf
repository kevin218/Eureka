indep_batches        False            # Independently treat each batch of files? Strongly recommended to leave this as False unless you have a clear reason to set it to True.

# Subarray region of interest

# Background parameters
ff_outlier           False            # Set False to use only background region (recommended for deep transits)
                                      # Set True to use full frame (works well for shallow transits/eclipses)

# Centroiding parameters

ctr_cutout_size      5                # Cutoff size all around the centroid after the coarse centroid calculation or first centroid guess when using the mgmc method.
centroid_tech        com              # (mgmc method param) Technique used for centroiding. Options: com, 1dg, 2dg
gauss_frame          100              # (mgmc method param) Half-width away from second centroid guess to include in centroiding map for gaussian widths. Recommend ~100 for defocused NIRCam photometry.

# 1/f noise correction for NIRCam photometric data

oneoverf_dist        350              # How many pixels away from the centroid should be considered as background? (used for 1/f correction)

# Photometric extraction parameters
phot_method          photutils        # photutils (aperture photometry using photutils), poet (aperture photometry using code from POET), or optimal (for optimal photometric extraction)
aperture_edge        exact            # center (pixel is included only if its center lies within the aperture), or exact (pixel is weighted by the fractional area that lies within the aperture)
aperture_shape       circle           # If phot_method is photutils or optimal: circle, ellipse, or rectangle. If phot_utils is poet: circle or hexagon. Used to set both the object aperture shape and the sky annulus shape
moving_centroid      False            # Boolean: False if the aperture should stay fixed on the median centroid location (recommended), or True if the aperture should track the moving centroid
interp_method        cubic            # Interpolate bad pixels. Options: None (if no interpolation should be performed), linear, nearest, cubic
skip_apphot_bg       False            # Skips the background subtraction during the aperture photometry step

# photap_b             70               # Size of photometry aperture y-radius in pixels (if aperture_shape is ellipse or rectangle)
