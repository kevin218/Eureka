Eureka! Tutorial Notebooks
==========================

Tutorial notebooks showcasing ``Eureka!`` functionality can be found in the navigation sidebar. 

You can also download and run these tutorials locally using Jupyter notebook, but please note that some notebook variables, such as directory and file paths, may need adjusting.

At the moment the number of available notebooks is small, but may be expanded in the future.
