Installation
============

Installation methods
--------------------

In order to have consistent, repeatable results across the ``Eureka!`` user community, we recommend that all general users install
the most recent stable release of ``Eureka!``, v0.9. The following installation instructions are written with this in mind,
and the most recent stable release is also available as a zipped archive `here <https://github.com/kevin218/Eureka/releases/tag/v0.9>`_.
Also note that if you are using a macOS device with an M1 processor, you will need to use the ``conda`` environment.yml file
installation instructions below as the pip dependencies fail to build on the M1 processor.


Initial environment preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is **strongly** recommended that you install ``Eureka!`` in a new ``conda`` environment as other packages you've previously
installed could have conflicting requirements with ``Eureka!``. You can install a lightweight version of conda at
`this link <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_. Once conda is installed, you can create a
new environment by doing:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create -n eureka python==3.9.7
	conda activate eureka

Option 1) With ``git`` and ``pip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once in your new conda environment, you can install ``Eureka!`` directly from source on
`GitHub <http://github.com/kevin218/Eureka>`_ using ``git`` and ``pip`` by running:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone -b v0.9 https://github.com/kevin218/Eureka.git
	cd Eureka
	pip install -e '.[jwst]'

To update your ``Eureka!`` installation to the most recent version, you can do the following within that Eureka folder:

.. code-block:: bash

	git pull
	pip install --upgrade '.[jwst]'

Option 2) With ``pip`` only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once in your new conda environment, you can install the ``Eureka!`` package with ``pip`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install -e git+https://github.com/kevin218/Eureka.git@v0.9#egg=eureka[jwst]

Other specific branches can be installed using:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install -e git+https://github.com/kevin218/Eureka.git@mybranchname#egg=eureka[jwst]

In order to use any of the demo ECF files, follow the instructions in the :ref:`Demos <demos>` section of the :ref:`Quickstart <quickstart>` page.


Including optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are also several optional dependency collections that can be installed with Eureka! to increase the flexibility of the software. These include:

- ``jwst`` which includes the necessary packages to run Stages 1-2 on JWST data.
- ``hst`` which includes the necessary packages to run Stage 3 on HST/WFC3 data.
- ``test`` which allows you to run our suite of pytest tests locally.
- ``pymc3`` which allows you to use the NUTS Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler implemented in PyMC3 as well as a gradient based optimizer which benefits from differentiable models. This also allows you to use the starry astrophysical model for modelling exoplanet transits, eclipses (including eclipse mapping signals), and phase curves.
- ``docs`` which allows you to build the documentation pages locally.
- ``jupyter`` which includes jupyter and ipykernel for convenience.

In the installation instructions above, the ``jwst`` optional dependency is used as we strongly recommend users run Stages 1 and 2 locally, but we wanted to give users the ability to opt-out of installing the dependencies installed with ``jwst`` if they didn't work on their system.

To install with one or more optional dependency collections, the above examples can be generalized upon. For example, to install with just the ``hst`` dependencies, one can replace ``[jwst]`` with ``[hst]``. Or if you want to install with multiple options, you can do things like ``[jwst,hst]``.

.. warning::
	To install the ``pymc3`` optional dependencies, you also need to install ``mkl-service`` which can only be installed from conda using ``conda install mkl-service``.


Installing with a ``conda`` environment.yml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also download ``Eureka!`` using ``git`` and set up a ``conda`` environment directly from the ``git`` repository if
you'd prefer not to use ``pip`` to install dependencies. To use the ``pymc3`` optional dependencies, replace ``environment.yml`` with ``environmenmt_pymc3.yml`` in the steps below.

To install using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone -b v0.9 https://github.com/kevin218/Eureka.git
	cd Eureka
	conda env create --file environment.yml --force
	conda activate eureka
	pip install --no-deps .

To update your ``Eureka!`` installation to the most recent version, you can do the following within that Eureka folder:

.. code-block:: bash

	git pull
	conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
	pip install --no-deps --upgrade .



CRDS Environment Variables
--------------------------

``Eureka!`` installs the JWST Calibration Pipeline as part of its requirements, and this also requires users to set the proper environment
variables so that it can download the proper reference files needed to run the pipeline. For users not on the internal STScI network,
two environment variables need to be set to enable this functionality. In your ``~/.zshrc`` (for Mac users) or ``~/.bashrc`` file (for bash
users), or other shell initialization file, add these two lines (specifying your desired location to cache the CRDS files,
e.g. ``/Users/your_name/crds_cache`` for Mac users or ``/home/your_name/crds_cache`` for Linux users):

	.. code-block:: bash

		export CRDS_PATH=/PATH/TO/FOLDER/crds_cache

		export CRDS_SERVER_URL=https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu

If these environment variables are not set, Stages 1-3 of the pipeline will fail.
