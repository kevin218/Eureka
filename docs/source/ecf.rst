.. _ecf:

Eureka! Control File (.ecf)
===========================

To run the different Stages of ``Eureka!``, the pipeline requires control files (.ecf) where Stage-specific parameters are defined (e.g. aperture size, path of the data, etc.).

In the following, we look at the contents of the ecf for Stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.


Stage 1
-------

.. include:: ../media/S1_template.ecf
   :literal:

suffix
''''''
Data file suffix (e.g. uncal).

ramp_fit_algorithm
''''''''''''''''''
Algorithm to use to fit a ramp to the frame-level images of uncalibrated files. Only default (i.e. the JWST pipeline) and mean can be used currently.


ramp_fit_max_cores
''''''''''''''''''
Fraction of processor cores to use to compute the ramp fits, options are ``none``, ``quarter``, ``half``, ``all``.


skip_*
''''''
If True, skip the named step.

.. note::
   Note that some instruments and observing modes might skip a step either way! See the `calwebb_detector1 docs <https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_detector1.html>`__ for the list of steps run for each instrument/mode by the STScI's JWST pipeline.

topdir + inputdir
'''''''''''''''''
The path to the directory containing the Stage 0 JWST data (uncal.fits).

topdir + outputdir
''''''''''''''''''
The path to the directory in which to output the Stage 1 JWST data and plots.

testing_S1
''''''''''
If True, only a single file will be used, outputs won't be saved, and plots won't be made. Useful for making sure most of the code can run.

default_ramp_fit_weighting
''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Define the method by which individual frame pixels will be weighted during the default ramp fitting process. The is specifically for the case where ``ramp_fit_algorithm`` is ``default``. Options are ``default``, ``fixed``, ``interpolated``, ``flat``, or ``custom``.


``default``: Slope estimation using a least-squares algorithm with an "optimal" weighting, see the `ramp_fitting docs <https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/ramp_fitting/description.html#optimal-weighting-algorithm>`__.

In short this weights each pixel, :math:`i`, within a slope following :math:`w_i = (i - i_{midpoint})^P`, where the exponent :math:`P` is selected depending on the estimated signal-to-noise ratio of each pixel (see link above).


``fixed``: As with default, except the weighting exponent :math:`P` is fixed to a precise value through the ``default_ramp_fit_fixed_exponent`` entry


``interpolated``: As with default, except the SNR to :math:`P` lookup table is converted to a smooth interpolation.


``flat``: As with default, except the weighting equation is no longer used, and all pixels are weighted equally.


``custom``: As with default, except a custom SNR to :math:`P` lookup table can be defined through the ``default_ramp_fit_custom_snr_bounds`` and ``default_ramp_fit_custom_exponents`` (see example .ecf file).


Stage 2
-------

 A full description of the Stage 2 Outputs is available here: :ref:`Stage 2 Output <s2-out>`

.. include:: ../media/S2_template.ecf
   :literal:

suffix
''''''
Data file suffix (e.g. rateints).

.. note::
	Note that other Instruments might used different suffixes!


slit_y_low & slit_y_high
''''''''''''''''''''''''
Controls the cross-dispersion extraction. Use None to rely on the default parameters.


waverange_start & waverange_end
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Modify the existing file to change the dispersion extraction (DOES NOT WORK). Use None to rely on the default parameters.


skip_*
''''''
If True, skip the named step.

.. note::
	Note that some instruments and observing modes might skip a step either way! See the `calwebb_spec2 docs <https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html>`__ for the list of steps run for each instrument/mode by the STScI's JWST pipeline.


testing_S2
''''''''''
If True, outputs won't be saved and plots won't be made. Useful for making sure most of the code can run.


hide_plots
''''''''''

topdir + inputdir
'''''''''''''''''
The path to the directory containing the Stage 1 JWST data.


topdir + outputdir
''''''''''''''''''
The path to the directory in which to output the Stage 2 JWST data and plots.







Stage 3
-------

.. include:: ../media/S3_template.ecf
   :literal:

ncpu
''''
Sets the number of cores being used when ``Eureka!`` is executed.
Currently, the only parallelized part of the code is the **background subtraction** for every individual integration and is being initialized in s3_reduce.py with:

:func:`util.BGsubtraction<eureka.lib.util.BGsubtraction>`

nfiles
''''''
Sets the maximum number of data files to analyze batched together.

max_memory
''''''''''
Sets the maximum memory fraction (0--1) that should be used by the loaded in data files. This will reduce nfiles if needed. Note that more RAM than this may be used during operations like sigma clipping, so you're best off setting max_memory <= 0.5.

suffix
''''''
If your data directory (``topdir + inputdir``, see below) contains files with different data formats, you want to consider setting this variable.


E.g.: Simulated NIRCam Data:

Stage 2 - For NIRCam, Stage 2 consists of the flat field correction, WCS/wavelength solution, and photometric calibration (counts/sec -> MJy). Note that this is specifically for NIRCam: the steps in Stage 2 change a bit depending on the instrument. The Stage 2 outputs are roughly equivalent to a "flt" file from HST.

- ``Stage 2 Outputs/*calints.fits`` - Fully calibrated images (MJy) for each individual integration. This is the one you want if you're starting with Stage 2 and want to do your own spectral extraction.

- ``Stage 2 Outputs/*x1dints.fits`` - A FITS binary table containing 1D extracted spectra for each integration in the "calint" files.


As we want to do our own spectral extraction, we set this variable to ``calints``.

.. note::
	Note that other Instruments might used different suffixes!

hst_cal
'''''''
Only used for HST analyses. The fully qualified path to the folder containing HST calibration files.

horizonsfile
''''''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. The path with respect to hst_cal to the horizons file you've downloaded from https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/. To get a new horizons file on that website, 1. Select "Vector Table", 2. Select "HST", 3. Select "@ssb" (Solar System Barycenter), 4. Select a date range that spans the days relevant to your observations. Then click Generate Ephemeris and click Download Results.

leapdir
'''''''
Only used for HST analyses. The folder with respect to hst_cal where leapsecond calibration files will be saved.

flatfile
''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. The path with respect to hst_cal to the flatfield file to use. The WFC3 flats can be downloaded `here (G102) <http://www.stsci.edu/~WFC3/grism-resources/G102/WFC3.IR.G102.flat.2.fits.gz>`_ and `here (G141) <http://www.stsci.edu/~WFC3/grism-resources/G141/WFC3.IR.G141.flat.2.fits.gz>`_; be sure to unzip the files after downloading them.

ywindow & xwindow
'''''''''''''''''
Can be set if one wants to remove edge effects (e.g.: many nans at the edges).

Below an example with the following setting:

.. code-block:: python

    ywindow     [5,64]
    xwindow     [100,1700]

.. image:: ../media/xywindow.png

Everything outside of the box will be discarded and not used in the analysis.

src_pos_type
''''''''''''
Determine the source position on the detector. Options: header, gaussian, weighted, max, or hst. The value 'header' uses the value of SRCYPOS in the FITS header.

record_ypos
'''''''''''
Option to record the cross-dispersion trace position and width (if Gaussian fit) for each integration.

centroidtrim
''''''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. The box width to cut around the centroid guess to perform centroiding on the direct images. This should be an integer.

centroidguess
'''''''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. A guess for the location of the star in the direct images in the format [x, y].

flatoffset
''''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. The positional offset to use for flatfielding. This should be formatted as a 2 element list with x and y offsets.

flatsigma
'''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. Used to sigma clip bad values from the flatfield image.

diffthresh
''''''''''
Only used for HST analyses. Sigma theshold for bad pixel identification in the differential non-destructive reads (NDRs).

bg_hw & spec_hw
'''''''''''''''
``bg_hw`` and  ``spec_hw`` set the background and spectrum aperture relative to the source position.

Let's looks at an **example** with the following settings:

.. code-block:: python

    bg_hw    = 23
    spec_hw  = 18

Looking at the fits file science header, we can determine the source position:

.. code-block:: python

    src_xpos = hdulist['SCI',1].header['SRCXPOS']-xwindow[0]
    src_ypos = hdulist['SCI',1].header['SRCYPOS']-ywindow[0]

Let's assume in our example that ``src_ypos = 29``.

(xwindow[0] and ywindow[0] corrects for the trimming of the data frame, as the edges were removed with the xwindow and ywindow parameters)

The plot below shows you which parts will be used for the background calculation (shaded in white; between the lower edge and src_ypos - bg_hw, and src_ypos + bg_hw and the upper edge) and which for the spectrum flux calculation (shaded in red; between src_ypos - spec_hw and src_ypos + spec_hw).

.. image:: ../media/bg_hw.png

bg_thresh
'''''''''
Double-iteration X-sigma threshold for outlier rejection along time axis.
The flux of every background pixel will be considered over time for the current data segment.
e.g: ``bg_thresh = [5,5]``: Two iterations of 5-sigma clipping will be performed in time for every background pixel. Outliers will be masked and not considered in the background flux calculation.

bg_deg
''''''
Sets the degree of the column-by-column background subtraction. If bg_deg is negative, use the median background of entire frame. Set to None for no background subtraction.
Also, best to emphasize that we're performing column-by-column BG subtraction

The function is defined in :func:`S3_data_reduction.optspex.fitbg<eureka.S3_data_reduction.optspex.fitbg>`

Possible values:

- ``bg_deg = None``: No backgound subtraction will be performed.
- ``bg_deg < 0``: The median flux value in the background area will be calculated and subtracted from the entire 2D Frame for this paticular integration.
- ``bg_deg => 0``: A polynomial of degree `bg_deg` will be fitted to every background column (background at a specific wavelength). If the background data has an outlier (or several) which is (are) greater than 5  * (Mean Absolute Deviation), this value will be not considered as part of the background. Step-by-step:

1. Take background pixels of first column
2. Fit a polynomial of degree  ``bg_deg`` to the background pixels.
3. Calculate the residuals (flux(bg_pixels) - polynomial_bg_deg(bg_pixels))
4. Calculate the MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation) of the greatest background outlier.
5. If MAD of the greatest background outlier is greater than 5, remove this background pixel from the background value calculation. Repeat from Step 2. and repeat as long as there is no 5*MAD outlier in the background column.
6. Calculate the flux of the polynomial of degree  ``bg_deg`` (calculated in Step 2) at the spectrum and subtract it.


p3thresh
''''''''
Only important if ``bg_deg => 0`` (see above). # sigma threshold for outlier rejection during background subtraction which corresponds to step 3 of optimal spectral extraction, as defined by Horne (1986).

p5thresh
''''''''
Used during Optimal Extraction. # sigma threshold for outlier rejection during step 5 of optimal spectral extraction, as defined by Horne (1986). Default is 10. For more information, see the source code of :func:`optspex.optimize<eureka.S3_data_reduction.optspex.optimize>`.

p7thresh
''''''''
Used during Optimal Extraction. # sigma threshold for outlier rejection during step 7 of optimal spectral extraction, as defined by Horne (1986). Default is 10. For more information, see the source code of :func:`optspex.optimize<eureka.S3_data_reduction.optspex.optimize>`.

fittype
'''''''
Used during Optimal Extraction. fittype defines how to construct the normalized spatial profile for optimal spectral extraction. Options are: 'smooth', 'meddata', 'wavelet', 'wavelet2D', 'gauss', or 'poly'. Using the median frame (meddata) should work well with JWST. Otherwise, using a smoothing function (smooth) is the most robust and versatile option. Default is meddata. For more information, see the source code of :func:`optspex.optimize<eureka.S3_data_reduction.optspex.optimize>`.

window_len
''''''''''
Used during Optimal Extraction. window_len is only used when fittype = 'smooth'. It sets the length scale over which the data are smoothed. Default is 31. For more information, see the source code of :func:`optspex.optimize<eureka.S3_data_reduction.optspex.optimize>`.

prof_deg
''''''''
Used during Optimal Extraction. prof_deg is only used when fittype = 'poly'. It sets the polynomial degree when constructing the spatial profile. Default is 3. For more information, see the source code of :func:`optspex.optimize<eureka.S3_data_reduction.optspex.optimize>`.

iref
''''
Only used for HST analyses. The file indices to use as reference frames for 2D drift correction. This should be a 1-2 element list with the reference indices for each scan direction.

curvature
'''''''''
Current options: 'None', 'correct'. Using 'None' will not use any curvature correction and is strongly recommended against for instruments with strong curvature like NIRSpec/G395. Using 'correct' will bring the center of mass of each column to the center of the detector and perform the extraction on this straightened trace. If using 'correct', you should also be using fittype = 'meddata'.

smooth_trace

Stage 5 Fit Parameters
----------------------

.. warning::
   The Stage 5 fit parameter file has the file extension ``.epf``, not ``.ecf``. These have different formats, and are not interchangeable.

This file describes the transit/eclipse and systematics parameters and their prior distributions. Each line describes a new parameter, with the following basic format:

``Name    Value    Free    PriorPar1    PriorPar2    PriorType``

``Name`` defines the specific parameter being fit for. Available options are:
   - Transit and Eclipse Parameters
      - ``rp`` - planet-to-star radius ratio, for the transit models.
      - ``fp`` - planet/star flux ratio, for the eclipse models.
   - Orbital Parameters
      - ``per`` - orbital period (in days)
      - ``t0`` - transit time (in days)
      - ``time_offset`` - (optional), the absolute time offset of your time-series data (in days)
      - ``inc`` - orbital inclination (in degrees)
      - ``a`` - a/R*, the ratio of the semimajor axis to the stellar radius
      - ``ecc`` - orbital eccentricity
      - ``w`` - argument of periapsis (degrees)
   - Phase Curve Parameters - the phase curve model allows for the addition of up to four sinusoids into a single phase curve
      - ``AmpCos1`` - Amplitude of the first cosine
      - ``AmpSin1`` - Amplitude of the first sine
      - ``AmpCos2`` - Amplitude of the second cosine
      - ``AmpSin2`` - Amplitude of the second sine
   - Limb Darkening Parameters
      - ``limb_dark`` - The limb darkening model to be used. Options are: ``['uniform', 'linear', 'quadratic', 'kipping2013', 'square-root', 'logarithmic', 'exponential', '4-parameter']``
      - ``uniform`` limb-darkening has no parameters, ``linear`` has a single parameter ``u1``, ``quadratic``, ``kipping2013``, ``square-root``, ``logarithmic``, and ``exponential`` have two parameters ``u1, u2``, ``4-parameter`` has four parameters ``u1, u2, u3, u4``
   - Systematics Parameters. Depends on the model specified in the Stage 5 ECF.
      - ``c0--c9`` - Coefficients for 0th to 3rd order polynomials. The polynomial coefficients are numbered as increasing powers (i.e. ``c0`` a constant, ``c1`` linear, etc.). The x-values of the polynomial are the time with respect to the mean of the time of the lightcurve time array. Polynomial fits should include at least ``c0`` for usable results.
      - ``r0--r2`` and ``r3--r5`` - Coefficients for the first and second exponential ramp models. The exponential ramp model is defined as follows: ``r0*np.exp(-r1*time_local + r2) + r3*np.exp(-r4*time_local + r5) + 1``, where ``r0--r2`` describe the first ramp, and ``r3--r5`` the second. ``time_local`` is the time relative to the first frame of the dataset. If you only want to fit a single ramp, you can omit ``r3--r5`` or set them as fixed to ``0``. Users should not fit all three parameters from each model at the same time as there are significant degeneracies between the three parameters; instead, it is recommended to set ``r0`` (or ``r3`` for the second ramp) to the sign of the ramp (-1 for decaying, 1 for rising) while fitting for the remaining coefficients.
      - ``step0`` and ``steptime0`` - The step size and time for the first step-function (useful for removing mirror segment tilt events). For additional steps, simply increment the integer at the end (e.g. ``step1`` and ``steptime1``).
   - White Noise Parameters - options are ``scatter_mult`` for a multiplier to the expected noise from Stage 3 (recommended), or ``scatter_ppm`` to directly fit the noise level in ppm.



``Free`` determines whether the parameter is ``fixed``, ``free``, ``white_fixed``, ``white_free``, ``independent``, or ``shared``.
``fixed`` parameters are fixed in the fitting routine and not fit for.
``free`` parameters are fit for according to the specified prior distribution, independently for each wavelength channel.
``white_fixed`` and ``white_free`` parameters are first fit using ``free`` on the white-light light curve to update the prior for the parameter, and then treated as ``fixed`` or ``free`` (respectively) for the spectral fits.
``shared`` parameters are fit for according to the specified prior distribution, but are common to all wavelength channels.
``independent`` variables set auxiliary functions needed for the fitting routines.



The ``PriorType`` can be U (Uniform), LU (Log Uniform), or N (Normal). If U/LU, then ``PriorPar1`` and ``PriorPar2`` are the lower and upper limits of the prior distribution. If N, then ``PriorPar1`` is the mean and ``PriorPar2`` is the stadard deviation of the Gaussian prior.

-------

.. include:: ../media/S6_template.ecf
   :literal:

allapers
''''''''
Boolean to determine whether Stage 6 is run on all the apertures considered in Stage 5. If
False, will just use the most recent output in the input directory.

y_unit
''''''
The unit to use when plotting and saving the output table. For transit observations
(or to plot the transmission spectrum from a phase curve observation), values can be
"Rp/Rs" or "(Rp/Rs)^2". For eclipse observations (or to plot the dayside emission
spectrum from a phase curve observation), the value must be "Fp/Fs".

y_scalar
''''''''
This parameter can be used to rescale the y-axis. If set to 100, the y-axis will be in units of
percent. If set to 1e6, the y-axis will be in units of ppm. If set to any other value other than
1, 100, 1e6, then the y-axis will simply be multiplied by that value and the scalar will be noted
in the y-axis label.

x_unit
''''''
The x-unit to use in the plot. This can be any unit included in astropy.units.spectral
(e.g. um, nm, Hz, etc.) but cannot include wavenumber units.

star_Rad
''''''''
The stellar radius. Used to compute the scale height if y_unit is transmission type and
isplots_S6>=3.

planet_Teq
''''''''''
The planet's zero-albedo, complete redistribution equlibrium temperature in Kelvin. Used to
compute the scale height if y_unit is transmission type and isplots_S6>=3.

planet_Mass
'''''''''''
The planet's mass in units of Jupiter masses. Used to compute the scale height if y_unit
is transmission type and isplots_S6>=3.

planet_Rad
''''''''''
The planet's radius in units of Jupiter radii. Set to None to use the average fitted radius.
Used to compute the scale height if y_unit is transmission type and isplots_S6>=3.

planet_mu
'''''''''
The mean molecular mass of the atmosphere (in atomic mass units).
Used to compute the scale height if y_unit is transmission type and isplots_S6>=3.

planet_R0
'''''''''
The reference radius (in Jupiter radii) for the scale height measurement. Set to None to
use the mean fitted radius. Used to compute the scale height if y_unit is transmission
type and isplots_S6>=3.

isplots_S6
''''''''''
Sets how many plots should be saved when running Stage 6. A full description of these
outputs is available here: :ref:`Stage 6 Output <s6-out>`.

hide_plots
''''''''''
If True, plots will automatically be closed rather than popping up on the screen.

topdir + inputdir
'''''''''''''''''
The path to the directory containing the Stage 5 JWST data.

topdir + outputdir
''''''''''''''''''
The path to the directory in which to output the Stage 6 JWST data and plots.

topdir + model_spectrum
'''''''''''''''''''''''
The path to a model spectrum to plot underneath the observations to show how the fitted results
compare to the input model for simulated observations or how the fitted results compare to a
retrieved model for real observations. Set to None if no model should be plotted.
The file should have column 1 as the wavelength and column 2 should contain the transmission
or emission spectrum. Any headers must be preceded by a #.

model_x_unit
''''''''''''
The x-unit of the model. This can be any unit included in astropy.units.spectral
(e.g. um, nm, Hz, etc.) but cannot include wavenumber units.

model_y_unit
''''''''''''
The y-unit of the model. Options include "Rp/Rs", "(Rp/Rs)^2", and "Fp/Fs".

model_y_scalar
''''''''''''''
Indicate whether model y-values have already been scaled (e.g. write 1e6 if
model_spectrum is in ppm).

model_zorder
''''''''''''
The zorder of the model on the plot (0 for beneath the data, 1 for above the data).

model_delimiter
'''''''''''''''
Delimiter between columns. Typical options: None (for whitespace), ',' for comma.
