Eureka! Outputs
===============

Stage 2 through Stage 6 of ``Eureka!`` can be configured to output plots of the pipeline's interim results as well as the data required to run further stages.


.. _s2-out:

Stage 2 Outputs
---------------

If ``skip_extract_1d`` is set in the Stage 2 ECF, the 1-dimensional spectrum will not be extracted, and no plots will be made. Otherwise, Stage 2 will extract the 1-dimensional spectrum from the calibrated images, and will plot the spectrum.

.. _s3-out:

Stage 3 Outputs
---------------

In Stage 3 through Stage 5, output plots are controlled with the ``isplots_SX`` parameter. The resulting plots are cumulative: setting ``isplots_S3 = 5`` will also create the plots specified in ``isplots_S3 = 3`` and ``isplots_S3 = 1``.

In Stage 3:
   - If ``isplots_S3`` = 1: ``Eureka!`` will plot the 2-dimensional, non-drift-corrected light curve, as well as variations in the source position and width on the detector.

Stage 4 Outputs
---------------

In Stage 4:
   - If ``isplots_S4`` = 1: ``Eureka!`` will plot the spectral drift per exposure, the drift-corrected 2-dimensional lightcurve with extracted bins overlaid, and the 1D light curves.

Stage 5 Outputs
---------------

In Stage 5:
   - If ``isplots_S5`` = 1: ``Eureka!`` will plot the fitted lightcurve model over the data in each channel. If fitting with a GP, an additional figure will be made showing the GP component. If fitting a sinusoid_pc model, another zoomed-in figure with binned data will be made to emphasize the phase variations. Finally, an additional plot compares the fits from different fitters.

   - If ``isplots_S5`` = 3: ``Eureka!`` will plot an RMS deviation plot for each channel to help check for correlated noise, plot the normalized residual distribution, and plot the fitting chains for each channel. If fitting a sinusoid_pc model, another zoomed-in figure with binned data in front of the unbinned data will be made to emphasize the phase variations.

.. _s6-out:

Stage 6 Outputs
---------------

In Stage 6:
   - If ``isplots_S6`` = 1: ``Eureka!`` will plot the transmission or emission spectrum, depending
     on the setting of ``y_unit``. If a model is provided, it will be plotted on the same figure
     along with points binned from that model to the resolution of the data.

   - If ``isplots_S6`` = 3: ``Eureka!`` will make another transmission plot (if ``y_unit`` is
     transmission type) with a second y-axis which is in units of atmospheric scale height.
