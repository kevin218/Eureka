Quickstart
============
Firstly, you have to update the params.yaml in the config directory with the observational parameters.
If you have done that, you navigate to the script directory in a termainal and type python run.py.
The simulated spectrum will be then saved in the runs_dir directory.  

An example for a simulated spectrum:
