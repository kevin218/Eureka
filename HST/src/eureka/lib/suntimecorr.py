    Notes
    -----
    The position vectors from coordtable are given in the following
    coordinate system:
    Reference epoch : J2000.0
    xy-plane : plane of the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    x-axis : out along ascending node of instantaneous plane of the Earth's
    orbit and the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    z-axis : along the Earth mean north pole at the reference epoch

    Ephemerides are often calculated for BJD, barycentric Julian date.
    That is, they are correct for observations taken at the solar
    system barycenter's distance from the target.  The BJD of our
    observation is the time the photons we observe would have crossed
    the sphere centered on the object and containing the barycenter.
    We must thus add the light-travel time from our observatory to
    this sphere.  For non-solar-system observations, we approximate
    the sphere as a plane, and calculate the dot product of the vector
    from the barycenter to the telescope and a unit vector to from the
    barycenter to the target, and divide by the speed of light.

    Properly, the coordinates should point from the standard location
    to the object.  Practically, for objects outside the solar system,
    the adjustment from, e.g., geocentric (RA-DEC) coordinates to
    barycentric coordinates has a negligible effect on the trig
    functions used in the routine.

    History:

    - 2005-12-01, Statia Luszcz
        Initial version.
    - 2006-03-09, jh
        Corrected 90deg error in algorithm, renamed,
        updated header, made Coordtable a positional
        arg since it's required, switched to radians.
    - 2007-06-28, jh
        Renamed to suntimecorr since we now use
        barycentric Julian date.
    - 2009-01-28, jh
        Change variables to long, use spline instead
        of linfit so we can use one HORIZONS file for
        the whole mission.
    - 2009-02-22, jh
        Reshape spline results to shape of obst.  Make
        it handle unsorted unput data properly.
        Header update.
    - 2010-07-10, patricio
        Converted to python.
    - 2010-11-01, patricio
        Docstring updated.
